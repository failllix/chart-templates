# Chart Templates
This is a dummy dashboard application showing a couple of charts built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Chart.js ([`react-chart-js-2`](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)).

It is supposed to help you out in your next "I need another dashboard to render some charts" moment and should serve as a grood starting ground to build off of.

Its based on React and uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for convenience functions such as routing, server-side rendering and many more. Check out the links below to learn more.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
